Over the last few weeks and through Election Day, millions of Americans cast their votes
not just for president, but for leaders at every level. Now the results are in, and we want
to congratulate President Trump and Senator Vance on their victory.
This is obviously not the outcome we had hoped for, given our profound disagreements
with the Republican ticket on a whole host of issues. But living in a democracy is about
recognizing that our point of view won't always win out, and being willing to accept the
peaceful transfer of power.
Michelle and l could not be prouder of Vice President Harris and Governor Walz - two
extraordinary public servants who ran a remarkable campaign, And we will always be
grateful to the staff and volunteers who poured their heart and soul into electing public
servants they truly believed in.
As l said on the campaign trail, America has been through a lot over the last few years -
from a historic pandemic and price hikes resulting from the pandemic, to rapid change
and the feeling a lot of folks have that, no matter how hard they work, treading water
is the best they can do. Those conditions have created headwinds for democratic
incumbents around the world, and last night showed that America is not immune.
The good news is that these problems are solvable - but only if we listen to each other,
and only if we abide by the core constitutional principles and democratic norms that
made this country great.
In a country as big and diverse as ours, we won't always see eye-to-eye on everything.
But progress requires us to extend good faith and grace - even to people with whom we
deeply disagree. That's how we've come this far, and it's how we'l keep building a country
that is more fair and more just, more equal and more free.
